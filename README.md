Using a Monte Carlo algorithm to get a better idea of whether the occurrence of the GTA VI Trailer 1 date/planned hour on the ["??? Tee"](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/gtawiki/images/9/97/SpecialClothing-GTAOee-%3F%3F%3FTee.jpg/revision/latest/) in GTA Online was a total coincidence, a foreshadowing, or a partial coincidence followed by an artificial adjustment of the trailer date in order to align with community speculations.

## Results

For a sequence of 19 letters of the English alphabet, generated randomly according to the letter frequency in English texts, there is a:
* 0.06% chance that its A1Z26 representation includes the date December 5, 2023 with the hour 9;
* 0.853% chance that its A1Z26 representation includes the date December 5, 2023 (followed by any hour—almost needless to say, as any individual digit can be a valid hour);
* 4.015% chance that its A1Z26 representation includes a date (and hour) within December 1–9, 2023;
* 4.746% chance that its A1Z26 representation includes a date (and hour) within December 2023.

All A1Z26 representations use 2 digits per character, like the one on the T-shirt. Dates/hours are allowed as DMYH, MDYH or YMDH, where the day, month and hour can have either 1 or 2 digits, and the year can have either 2 or 4 digits. Mixed field lengths are allowed for days/months/hours within the same datetime, as the `1252309` sequence also had the day on one digit and the hour on two.

As you can see in `daily_chances.xlsx` (or `chart.png`):
* The 5<sup>th</sup> is most often the most frequent day of the month due to 5 being the position in the alphabet of 'e', the most frequent letter in English (however, in the T-shirt sequence its appearance was due to the letter 'y', not 'e');
* The days of the month December 2023 in general appear more frequently than those of the neighboring months. The reason why the dates in October and November 2023 are less frequent is that `10` and `11` appear less often than `12`, which is because the letters 'j' and 'k' are much less frequent than 'l'. The reason why the dates in January 2024 are less frequent is that `24` appears less often than `23`, which is because 'x' is much less frequent than 'w'.

## Conclusion

Although causality almost surely existed, the chance that `1252309` formed unintentionally (and it is thus the cause, not the consequence) is too high for its appearance to be considered **proof** that the message "One day will reveal all" referred to the trailer day (another possible meaning of the message can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/1g0hf5j/comment/lrkxhmb/)).
